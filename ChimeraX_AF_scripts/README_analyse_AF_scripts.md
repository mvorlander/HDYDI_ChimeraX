ChimeraX AlphaFold Analysis Scripts
===================================

These ChimeraX scripts provide an automated way to analyze AlphaFold predictions. They are designed to process predictions from the Alphafold 3 webserver,  hits from VBC Alphafold2 screen implementation by Dominik Handler, and the `auto‚Äêalphafold.sh` runs by Juraj Ahel. The scritps generate interface contact visualizations, save interface residues to files, align all predicitons and create interactive sliders to browse models easily.

Overview
--------

There are three main scripts provided, depending on the source of the Alphafold predictions:

1.  **analysis\_af\_screen\_hit.cxc**
   
2.  **analyse\_af3\_prediction.cxc**

3.  **analyse\_auto-alphafold\_prediction.cxc**
    
     *   **Output:**
        *   Generates interface contact visualizations by drawing pseudobonds between contacting residues.
        *   Labels pseudobonds with residue names and numbers.
        *   Saves contact residue data to text files.
        *   Creates named selections for interface residues.
        *   Combines interface selections and creates an mseries slider for model comparison.
### Visual Outputs

*   **Pseudobonds and Labels:**  
    The scripts create pseudobonds between residues that are in spatial proximity and display labels with the residue names and numbers for each contacting pair.
    
*   **Named Selections:**  
    Each script creates frozen (named) selections for the interface residues (e.g., `interfaces_<unique-string>_rank_X`). A combined selection (`interfaces_overlap_<unique-string>`) is also created, which shows the overlapping residues identified in all predictions.
    
*   **Coloring and Slider:**  
    The models are colored (using the "rainbow" and "byhetero" schemes) to help visually distinguish chains and interfaces. An mseries slider is generated so that users can cycle through the different models easily.
    

Installation and Setup
----------------------

1.  **Save the Scripts Locally:**  
    Save the provided `.cxc` script files (e.g., `analysis_af_screen_hit.cxc`, `analyse_af3_prediction.cxc`, and `analyse_auto-alphafold_prediction.cxc`) in a local directory on your computer.  
    _Example Path:_  
    `/Users/your.name/Library/CloudStorage/YourCloud/ChimeraX/scripts/`
    
2.  **Add Startup Aliases:**  
    To make it easy to run these scripts from the ChimeraX command line, add the following alias lines to your ChimeraX startup commands. In ChimeraX, these can be set under **Preferences > Startup**.  
    Replace the example path with the path to your scripts directory.
    
    ```
    alias analysis_af_screen_hit runscript /PATH/TO/YOUR/scripts/analysis_af_screen_hit.cxc $1 $2
    alias analyse_af3 runscript /PATH/TO/YOUR/scripts/analyse_af3_prediction.cxc $1 $2
    alias analyse_auto-AF runscript /PATH/TO/YOUR/scripts/analyse_auto-alphafold_prediction.cxc $1 $2
    ```
    
    For example, if your scripts are stored in `/Users/your.name/ChimeraX/scripts`, your startup commands might look like this:
    
    ```
    alias analyse_af_screen_hit runscript /Users/your.name/ChimeraX/scripts/analyse_af_screen_hit.cxc $1 $2
    alias analyse_af3 runscript /Users/your.name/ChimeraX/scripts/analyse_af3_prediction.cxc $1 $2
    alias analyse_auto-AF runscript /Users/your.name/ChimeraX/scripts/analyse_auto-alphafold_prediction.cxc $1 $2
    ```
    
3.  **Restart ChimeraX:**  
    After editing your startup preferences, restart ChimeraX to load the aliases.
    

Usage
-----

Once installed, you can run the scripts from the ChimeraX command line using the defined aliases. Each script requires two arguments:

*   **First argument:** The path to the directory containing the AlphaFold prediction files.
*   **Second argument:** A unique string (e.g., a UniProt ID or hit name) that is used in the file name matching and output file naming.
* **Make sure to run the commands in a clean ChimeraX session without any models open**!.  Otherwise, the alignment of predictions and combination into a slider
* **Enclose file paths in quoation marks to avoid issues with spaces in file names or special characters!!** 

### Example Commands

*   **For an AlphaFold screen hit:**
    
    ```
    analyse_af_screen_hit "/path/to/AF/screen/directory" UNIQUE_HIT_STRING
    ```
    
*   **For an AlphaFold 3 prediction:**
    
    ```
    analyse_af3 "/path/to/AF3/prediction/directory" CUSTOM NAME
    ```
    For AF3 
*   **For an `auto-alphafold.sh` prediction:**
    
    ```
    analyse_auto-AF "/path/to/auto_AF/prediction/directory" UNIQUE_HIT_STRING
    ```
    

After running the command, the script will process the files, display pseudobonds with labels, save output files (contact residue files and pseudobond data), and generate a slider to browse through the models.

Final Notes
-----------

*   **File Naming and Organization:**  
    Make sure your prediction directory structure and file naming conventions match those expected by the scripts. Adjust wildcard patterns if necessary.
    
*   **Interface Residues:**  
    The interface residues identified by these scripts are based on spatial proximity criteria, not directly on the JSON score files. Visual inspection and further validation may be necessary.
    
*   **Customization:**  
    Feel free to modify the scripts as needed to fit your workflow or to add additional processing/visualization features.
